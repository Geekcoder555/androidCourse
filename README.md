<ul>
  <li><h4>Connect3</h4></li>
    <p>Simple game to practice Animations</p>
  <li><h4>Currency Converter</h4></li>
    <p>Basic app to explore math concepts in Android</p>
  <li><h4>EggTimer</h4></li>
    <p>Simple app to practice timers</p>
  <li><h4>Guess the Celebrity</h4></li>
    <p>Sort of a quiz App in which the player names the celebrity on the Image.</p>
    <p>Involved some more advanced topics such as fetching data from a website to populate the Lists with the names and images of the Celebrities and handling exceptions.</p>
  <li><h4>HackerNews Reader</h4></li>
    <p>Using the <a href="https://github.com/HackerNews/API" target="_blank">HackerNews API</a> this App shows a list of the 20 top stories of the moment, and when the user clicks on the list item, is taken to another Activity with a WebView that displays the Article, as if the user had just opened a Browser.</p>
    <p>Good practice for JSON, Databases and WebViews.</p>
  <li><h4>Whats the Weather</h4></li>
    <p>This app uses the <a href="http://openweathermap.org/api">Open Weather Map API</a> to fetch the weather information of a city entered by the user and displays the description and temperature.</p>
    <p>The course project only uses the Description, but I included the temperature as an extra, as well as some improvements on the layout.</p>
    
</ul>
